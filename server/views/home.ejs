      Hi Verto â€” I'm Aaditya. You won't be able to use Google authentication, the PhonePe
      payment integration or the forget password feature in this environment because the required credentials are not
      provided. I recommend signing in with your email and password.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      For a detailed walkthrough of the integrations and APIs, please watch the Loom
      video I shared: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/adf5fdac5b9b4da4a80e2bb585b9fa9b?sid=c6a8f183-7255-4b94-89db-0e56f380f131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch the Loom demo</a>.
      It demonstrates Google authentication and the PhonePe payment flow using an
      environment that contains the required credentials.
      I have given a lot of time and efforts to scale it from a basic CRUD app to a multi vendor 
      platform. I hope you guys sit through the video and watch me expain it.
